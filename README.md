# Data-Structures-with-CPP
Thorough walkthrough of C++ implementations of common data structures

Labor of love/hate. Work in progress only to be updated when I am sick of 
dealing with ReactJS. This is not a book. This is not for sale. I like C/C++
because it is faster than anything else (truth) and you can see where things
are going (desk check) with pointers. It takes thought, not an #include or external library.  ;)

Make sure you have g++ up on your system:

I've included (or will include) compiled and un-compiled mini-programs. Look up how to do it... short and long in your terminal:

$ gcc <filename.cpp> -o <filename>     <-- if you decide to steal mine and make your own changes... 
then, 
$ ./<filename>
